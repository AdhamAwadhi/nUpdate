# nUpdate - The easy update-solution

nUpdate is a modern update system providing high security and an easy-to-use interface.

**IMPORTANT: This is currently a Pre-Alpha-version of nUpdate. Make sure to wait for an Alpha-version in order to get a working and functional version.**

  - Easy management of update packages 
  - Easy usable library
  - Automated updating for all clients
  - Many configuration settings which let you control your updates easily
  - Secured update packages by signing with SHA512 and 8912 Bit RSA-keys
  - Smart error handling with automated resetting data if an operation failed
  - Interfaces and event system provide the possibility to use own Graphic User Interfaces that can be shown to the client

### Version
0.1.0.0 Pre-Alpha Build 6 (Not stable and features missing)

### Notes
Help and tips are appreciated. If you don't want to support the development of nUpdate and just use it, then it is recommended to wait for the first Alpha-version. Current Pre-Alpha-version could contain lots of problems and bugs which will be fixed till then. Also these version are only usable with instructions from the developer. The whole solution is currently just OpenSource to get a better collaboration with other devs and let the project grow up step by step.

### Website
* [nUpdate] - The official website of the nUpdate-project.
* [@nUpdateLib] - The official twitter account of the nUpdate-project.

### Installation

There is currently no real installation, just download the whole solution and build it. For users that want to test nUpdate out, see above.
A documentation on how to use nUpdate's components and how to customize it will follow as soon as the project has reached a usable state.

### Development

Want to contribute as said above? Great!
Just use GitHub's functions for creating issues on problems so that I could have a look at them and decide what to do etc. If you already have an idea on what to do, make sure to fork nUpdate and create a PullRequest. It would be an advantage if you would do that on the current commit as nearly every day new commits arrive. This wouldn't consecutively result in the problem that your fork is some commits behind master.

### Todo's
There are still a lot of things to do till a usable version will appear. I'm giving my best to hurry up a bit.
